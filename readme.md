# StreamSets Data Collector Tutorials

The following tutorials demonstrate some StreamSets [Data Collector](http://github.com/streamsets/datacollector/) features. Clone this repository to your machine to follow along and get familiar with using Data Collector.

- [Log Shipping to Elasticsearch](tutorial-1/readme.md)
Read weblog files from a local filesystem directory, decorate some of the fields (e.g. GeoIP Lookup), and write them to Elasticsearch.

The Data Collector documentation also includes an [extended tutorial](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/#Tutorial/Overview.html) that walks through basic Data Collector functionality, including creating, previewing and running a pipeline, and creating alerts.
